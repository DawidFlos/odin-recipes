    <h3>Dish description</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>American goulash</strong> was invented to stetch a small amount of beef 
        into enough food for a not-so-small family.
    </p>
    
    <p>It's a simple dish, without simple taste, prefect for your weeknight dinner.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 large bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Hungarian paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart chicken broth or water</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded white Cheddar cheese (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat.
            Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir,
            until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
            <p>Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes.
            Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</p>
        </li>

        <p></p>

        <li>
            <p>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes.</p>
            <p>Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar,
            swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer.</p>
            <p>Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>

        <p></p>

        <li>
            <p>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer.
            Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender,
            about 12 minutes.</p>
            <p>Check for doneness after 10 minutes.</p>
        </li>

        <p></p>

        <li>
            Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves.
            Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes.
            Taste and season as desired.
        </li>
