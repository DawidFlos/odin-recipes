        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
           This <strong>Pork Fried Rice</strong> recipe is my revised version of another recipe.
           The pork and vegetables are seasoned with garlic and ginger.
        </p>
        <p>
           I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. 
           I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish 
           only a slight flavor difference.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
