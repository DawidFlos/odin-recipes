        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>
           This <strong>Pork Fried Rice</strong> recipe is my revised version of another recipe.
           The pork and vegetables are seasoned with garlic and ginger.
           I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. 
           I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish 
           only a slight flavor difference.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) boneless pork loin chop, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 green onion, chopped</li>

            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup cold cooked rice</li>

          </ul>
